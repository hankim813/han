    <h1>the final lap.</h1>
    <p>
      Today was a big day. For the past 11 weeks, I’ve been fully immersed in <a href="http://devbootcamp.com">Devbootcamp</a>, an intensive coding program that aims to teach its students how to become a full-fledged junior developer in an audacious 12-week time frame. Now that I have one week left in the program (excluding the next 2 weeks of vacation for the holidays), I can finally see the finish line. 
      <br><br>
      This morning my cohort aka the Largemouth Bass, which is made up of 21 aspiring developers, pitched a total of 15 final project app ideas to our entire program. Of those 15 pitches, I am humbled that mine was elected to be one of the <u>five</u> app ideas that will become a reality in the next three weeks.
      <br><br>
      It’s overwhelming, scary, nerve-wracking, but at the same time I feel sublime excitement, joy, and motivation. Never have I felt an inner passion for a project burn as bright and powerful as the one I have for this. 
      <br><br>
      The show time is here. It is crunch time. The 4th quarter. The two-minute drive. The last set play. The chips are all in. The last lap is here and everyone is squeezing out their last sprint to the checker marks. The crowd has risen to their feet and all the eyes are fixated on us.
      <br><br>
      It’s time to prove to everyone what we’re made of and I couldn’t be any more excited. 
      <br><br>
      The next three weeks will be one of the most amazing learning experience of my life and as my team’s leader, I am more than willing to accept this incredible challenge. My team will be tackling full force <strong>SIX</strong> completely new technologies and frameworks that are not familiar to us to make this app kick unforeseen levels of ass.
      <br><br>
      I won’t expound on what exactly the app idea is, but just know that once this mobile app is finished, you’ll never have a shitty bar hopping experience ;)
